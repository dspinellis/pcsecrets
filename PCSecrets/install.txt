Install

For Windows, the installer .exe is the easiest option. The zip file can be used for all platforms.
It contains rudimentary install and uninstall scripts for Ubuntu (and derivatives), otherwise it's
a manual install.

A Java runtime is required for execution.  You can use the  Oracle/Sun Java, or OpenJDK on Linux.
PCSecrets requires at least Java version 6, but the latest Java version 7 is recommended. If you
have Java 6 installed, you would be advised to replace it with the latest Java 7 as there are known
to be security issues with the earlier versions. There are also problems with the Nimbus UI Look
and Feel (the best looking interface) with Java 6 prior to version 1.6.10 (Mac users take note).

Installating a new version

It's OK to install a new version over the top of an existing PCSecrets installation. You could
export your secrets first for safety but this shouldn't really be necessary. If you do, don't
forget to delete the exported secrets afterwards as they are not encrypted. 

Documentation

Full documentation is provided in doc.html. An up-to-date version of this can be found at
http://pcsecrets.sourceforge.net/doc.html and via the PCSecrets Help menu.

Cipher key length

Current versions of Oracle Java have a deliberate in-built cipher key size restriction of 128 bits.
This can be removed by installing the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction
Policy Files.

PCSecrets will by default use a 256 bit key, but will automatically reduce this to 128 if the Java
runtime indicates that this is the maximum allowed. If the Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files
are subsequently installed, in order for PCSecrets to start using the longer key length, you must use
the 'Regenerate Ciphers' option of the File menu, as described in the PCSecrets docs.
